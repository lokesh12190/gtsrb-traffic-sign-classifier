## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** — a well-known multi-class image classification benchmark in the field of **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and autonomous driving.  
It was first introduced at the **International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011**.

**Contents:**
- **43 traffic sign classes**, including speed limits, warnings, and direction signs.
- Real-world images taken under varying conditions (lighting, occlusion, rotation, etc.).
- **Official training set** with images and annotations.
- **Official test set** with images, plus extended ground-truth labels.
- Additional feature files (HOG, Haar-like, hue histograms) — *not used in this project*.
